# SwissMicros Factory Defaults

This repository hosts the factory default files for various **SwissMicros** calculator models. It serves as a central location for users to download and restore their devices to their original factory state.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main categories:

- **[`Pioneer_Models/`](./Pioneer_Models)**: Contains files for models based on the Pioneer platform (e.g., DM32, DM42, DM41X). Each model has its own dedicated subdirectory containing default files like help files, programs, and off images.
- **[`Voyager_Models/`](./Voyager_Models)**: Contains firmware files (`.hex`) for models based on the Voyager platform (e.g., DM11, DM12, DM15, DM16, DM41).

## Usage

To restore your calculator to its factory defaults, you will need to apply the appropriate files for your specific model.

For detailed step-by-step instructions on how to use these files, please refer to **[`instructions.md`](./instructions.md)**.
